E-Com SupportBot: NLP Concept Map
----------------------------------

1. Text Preprocessing
   - Concepts: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, normalization.
   - Used In: Cleaning user input before feeding to ML models.
   - Tools: NLTK, spaCy.

2. Feature Extraction
   - Concepts: Bag of Words, TF-IDF, word embeddings, sentence embeddings.
   - Used In: Converting text to numerical vectors for model training.
   - Tools: Scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, Sentence-Transformers.

3. Intent Classification
   - Concepts: Supervised classification, intent tagging.
   - Used In: Predicting what the user wants (refund, order_status, etc.).
   - Tools: Logistic Regression, BERT, DistilBERT.

4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   - Concepts: Entity extraction, sequence labeling.
   - Used In: Detecting order IDs, product names, user-specific details.
   - Tools: spaCy, custom fine-tuning.

5. Text Similarity & Semantic Search
   - Concepts: Cosine similarity, semantic matching.
   - Used In: Matching user query with FAQ or product database.
   - Tools: Sentence-Transformers, Scikit-learn.

6. Dialogue Management
   - Concepts: Context tracking, state management, multi-turn dialogue.
   - Used In: Managing conversation flow between user and bot.
   - Tools: Custom Python logic or Rasa-like design.

7. Response Generation
   - Concepts: Template-based and retrieval-based responses.
   - Used In: Generating or selecting chatbot replies.
   - Tools: JSON response templates, optional LLM integration.

8. Evaluation Metrics
   - Concepts: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
   - Used In: Evaluating performance of intent classifier and NER models.
   - Tools: Scikit-learn.

9. Data Annotation & Dataset Design
   - Concepts: Labeling intents, designing training data.
   - Used In: Building the chatbot’s core knowledge base (intents.json, faqs.csv).
   - Tools: Manual labeling, CSV/JSON structuring.

10. Integration & Deployment
    - Concepts: REST APIs, backend-frontend communication, model serving.
    - Used In: Integrating chatbot into E-commerce website frontend.
    - Tools: FastAPI, Flask, React, Docker, Render/AWS.

Summary:
---------
This project covers both traditional and modern NLP approaches:
- Traditional: TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Bag-of-Words.
- Modern: BERT-based embeddings, semantic search.
- Applied NLP Engineering: Deployment, data management, and web integration.

By completion, E-Com SupportBot demonstrates a full NLP pipeline:
User Query → Preprocessing → Intent Recognition → Entity Extraction → Response → API Integration.
